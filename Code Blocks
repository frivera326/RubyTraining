Code Blocks

1) What is a code block= A block consists of chunks of code. You assign a name to a block. The code in the block is always enclosed within braces ({}). A block is always invoked from a function with the same name as that of the block. This means that if you have a block with the name test, then you use the function test to invoke this block. You invoke a block by using the yield statement.

5) Sort= Provides a camparison 

6) Inject= An accumulator of values
